Hi! I'm Shashank Chandrasekaran, a first year graduate MS student in ECE, specialzing in Power and Energy. I am very excited to be a part of MDST and can't wait to work together on the projects. What I am looking for is to know how it is to work as a team on a high level project. One thing about me is, that most people don't know about, that I can finish two large pizzas in one sitting!
